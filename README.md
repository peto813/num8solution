## Comments

* If given more time to complete the task I would implement code to calculate holidays that fall at a specific weekend of the month. 

* I would also implement-front end validation ( required fields, regex pattern validation, and numerical fields) for start date, number of days and country code.

* Furthermore, country codes could be used to build a complex dictionary of holidays per country.
